<h1></h1>

A website that people can order pizzas in it. We get our pizza menu from an API.

Technologies used in this project:
- Vite
- React
- React Router (v6.4+)
- Tailwind css
- Redux toolkit
- Thunks middleware
- Geolocation API

`Note that most of the times the Geolocation API may not work  peoperly it would be better to write the address manually.`
